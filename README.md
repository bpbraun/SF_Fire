# SF Fire README

-The deliverable is the html file (emailed to Syrus)
-A reproducible version of the deliverable is available in this repository as an Rmarkdown.  You can open this in Rstudio and run after
intstalling the neccessary packages (`tidyverse` and `lubridate`)
-No commerical software was used, everything is open source
-All the tasks were completed.  If given more time, I would have formatted the graphs more and done more analysis on the open ended question
-I spent right around 4 hours on the project.  In many ways, just getting the data was the most difficult part.
-To view the working version, look at the Rmarkdown to see code which is also available in the html.  The html is actually saved as an 
Rnotebook so all the data and code is embedded in the file.
