Background
==========
Our public safety platforms analyze fire department incident data to provide better analytics for a fire department. As a result, we want you to analyze similar data for us. A key metric for fire department performance is turnout performance.  Turnout is defined as the duration of time between when a unit is dispatched and when the unit is enroute.

Tasks
-----
Task 1) There are perceived trends that tend to occur effecting turnout performance.  Your task is to explore the validity of each trend.  For each trend, present analysis in the form of visualization (chart, table, etc).

    * Evening incidents have slower turnout times.  Note: Evening incidents are incidents that are created between the hours of 10:00 PM and 6:00 AM.
    * Units with back to back responses have slower turnout times.  A back to back response is defined by a unit being dispatched within 10 minutes of becoming available.

Task 2) are there additional trends that would be helpful for the department to know? You may use additional datasources if interested.  

Data
----
* The data can be exported from DataSF in your preferred format (CSV, JSON, etc)
* The entire dataset is 4.79M rows
* Access and documentation is available [here](https://data.sfgov.org/Public-Safety/Fire-Department-Calls-for-Service/nuek-vuh3)

Notes
-----
* Use your tools and/or programming languages of choice to perform analysis.
* The deliverable can be in your format of choice - HTML, Excel, Jupyter Notebook, R script, etc.
* It would be sufficient for the solution to only handle a subset of the data, but please document any limitations and how to load data.
* We would like for you to spend up to 4 hours. It is okay if you spend less or more time so long as your submission is within 24 hours.

Deliverable
-----------
* Link to a Github repository with your commits as you originally made them. Since we like to have indication of your progress, commit as you go along and do not squash them or just have a single commit.
* There should be a README in the repo with:
    * steps to run/install your analysis if appropriate. Instructions should be understandable by a technical but non-data scientist person. 
    * if using 3rd-party commercial tools that we may not have access to, please describe where and how you used them.  
    * did you complete all the tasks? comment as needed.
    * how much time did you spend on the project?
    * Add screenshots to the repo that show the results/working version.
* Assume the person testing your project will be on OSX but if you do not have access to OSX machine, provide needed steps to run your solution on any other OS.
