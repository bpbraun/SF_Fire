# SF Fire README

-A reproducible version of the deliverable is available in this repository as an Rmarkdown.  You can open this in Rstudio and run after
intstalling the neccessary packages (`tidyverse` and `lubridate`)  
-To view the working version, look at the Rmarkdown to see code which is also available in the html.  The html is actually saved as an 
Rnotebook so all the data and code is embedded in the file.
